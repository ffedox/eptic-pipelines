# TO DO:

# Update Python script to not align all texts again next time


I used two environments to avoid conflicts.

Tasks involving basically everything and Bertalign require

conda activate mynewenv

Tasks involving specifically transcription w/crisperwhisper require

conda activate crisperWhisper

To use whisperX

conda activate whisperx
