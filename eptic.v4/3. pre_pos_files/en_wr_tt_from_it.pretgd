Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we share the concerns about what is happening in Tunisia and express our sadness about the many people who have lost their lives during the protests .
</s>
<s id="1473:2">
The new and confused situation that began after the flight of former President , Mr Ben Ali , must now lead to the objective that many have asked for : the start of economic and social reforms to match the expectations of the vast majority of the population and the opening up of democratic forums , to ensure that civil society and the various opposition forces are increasingly involved in public life and in government .
</s>
<s id="1473:3">
Obviously , all countries have the right to determine their own path , but we are keen for these reforms to be carried out and for the changes to be real and not merely window dressing .
</s>
<s id="1473:4">
What is happening in Tunisia at the moment poses questions for all of us and poses questions for Europe , with all its delays and mistakes .
</s>
<s id="1473:5">
In 1995 , the European Union launched the partnership programme with the Mediterranean in Barcelona .
</s>
<s id="1473:6">
This was supposed to include economic , political , military and even social and human cooperation , but not even in the 2 key objectives has this been achieved .
</s>
<s id="1473:7">
In terms of the economy , there has been a drastic reduction in regional and infrastructural projects because the funds never arrived from Member States and those from the Commission remain in standby .
</s>
<s id="1473:8">
The promised free trade zone does not exist , but the most obvious failure is on the political level , and we need to be fully aware of this , Commissioner .
</s>
<s id="1473:9">
The Union for the Mediterranean was launched in 2008 , but remains a façade .
</s>
<s id="1473:10">
The summit that was supposed to be held in November 2010 has been postponed indefinitely .
</s>
<s id="1473:11">
The problem is that the various European governments are not interested and do not see any interest in real cooperation .
</s>
<s id="1473:12">
They prefer to maintain relationships with questionable regimes that are wedded to the defence of their undemocratically managed national resources , whilst millions of young people live without any future prospects but emigration , which is increasingly difficult .
</s>
<s id="1473:13">
It is no great surprise then that , spurred on by the economic and social crisis , the protests in Tunisia have turned into a tidal wave capable of having a heavy impact on the existing power structure .
</s>
<s id="1473:14">
European political realism is no longer useful as a result of the fear of Islamic fundamentalism , and perhaps the time has come to finally shelve that post-colonial attitude that tends to re-emerge every now and then in relations with North African countries .
</s>
<s id="1473:15">
Indeed , taking Barcelona as a starting point , Europe needs a new vision of its southern reaches and the Mediterranean , which must be more credible than in the past .
</s>
<s id="1473:16">
This implies a complete overhaul of the partnership and neighbourhood policies that have been followed thus far , and I would insist that you attend to this , Commissioner .
</s>
<s id="1473:17">
We can not hide the fact that both the Commission and the Council were even ready to start discussions with Tunisia for an advanced status agreement .
</s>
<s id="1473:18">
On the basis of what criteria it was thought that all this was possible is still to be explained .
</s>
<s id="1473:19">
We need to change tack - change gear - and we are telling the Commission and the Council that this can be achieved by showing more conviction in giving Parliament a role in the elaboration and application of a new idea of partnership with the countries of the Mediterranean .
</s>
<s id="1473:20">
All of this is not solely in the interest of these countries but is , above all , in the interest of Europe .
</s>
<s id="1473:21">
Many of the problems that Europe appears to have can only be tackled and resolved by a productive and virtuous relationship with all the Maghreb countries .
</s>
<s id="1473:22">
Supporting economic and democratic reforms , as well as simultaneously deploying all the necessary antidotes to fundamentalism and terrorism , is a difficult road but is the only one to take .
</s>
<s id="1473:23">
There is reason to hope that the tragic and bitter lesson being imparted by Tunisia can serve to give all of us a better understanding of what is worth doing and what is worth changing in terms of Europe's actions .

<s id="1474:1">
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should first of all like to thank the President , who is doing us the honour of chairing a debate on an issue that is so very important for industrial policy and the internal market .
</s>
<s id="1474:2">
I should also like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Stihler , who worked exhaustively on this proposal and , thanks to her commitment , has enabled us to reach an agreement at second reading .
</s>
<s id="1474:3">
I also wish to express my sincere thanks to all the shadow rapporteurs and the Chair of the committee on the internal market and consumer protection , Mr Harbour .
</s>
<s id="1474:4">
Your collective efforts were crucial in reaching a turning point in negotiations between the European institutions on this extremely technical dossier .
</s>
<s id="1474:5">
The Commission welcomes the second-reading compromise between Parliament and the Council since , irrespective of its technical nature , this is a dossier of great importance .
</s>
<s id="1474:6">
The adoption of the regulation on construction products represents an inestimably significant step forward for the entire European construction sector .
</s>
<s id="1474:7">
Construction products account for 3 percent of gross domestic product in Europe and , in terms of employment , activities related to the construction sector account for 6.5 percent of Europe's GDP and 7.5 percent of employment .
</s>
<s id="1474:8">
Altogether , this means that the construction sector accounts for 10 percent of the European economy , as the rapporteur noted in her speech .
</s>
<s id="1474:9">
Furthermore , the adoption of the regulation on construction products constitutes an important step forward in terms of simplifying and improving the legislation , whilst , at the same time , consolidating the internal market for construction products .
</s>
<s id="1474:10">
This was also the first practical application of the principles enshrined in the Small Business Act .
</s>
<s id="1474:11">
In effect , EU law will finally provide European enterprises - and particularly micro-enterprises - with tools that help them rather than the exact opposite , that is to say , forms to fill out , bureaucratic procedures and extra obligations .
</s>
<s id="1474:12">
I can not but be satisfied by this outcome , particularly with regard to the solutions provided to 3 issues that had been thought , in the past , to be more complicated .
</s>
<s id="1474:13">
Firstly , with regard to the issue of hazardous substances , the Commission will draft a report on this important issue , keeping Parliament informed and , if necessary , presenting any further legislative proposals .
</s>
<s id="1474:14">
Secondly , there is the special treatment reserved for micro-enterprises , which have always been considered essential in order to safeguard the principles of the Small Business Act .
</s>
<s id="1474:15">
The outcome achieved satisfies this criterion as it retains the possibility for simplified procedures for micro-enterprises .
</s>
<s id="1474:16">
Lastly , various parts of the text recognise the need to reduce the administrative and testing obligations on enterprises , partly by introducing simplified procedures for CE marking , but also by keeping the use of European Technical Assessments optional .
</s>
<s id="1474:17">
In any case , as indicated by the Statement by the European Commission annexed to the Council's position at first reading , we will need to check that the chosen solutions are truly the best to deal with existing needs .
</s>
<s id="1474:18">
In particular , we will have to avoid subjecting enterprises - and particularly micro-enterprises - to unjustified or , in any case , unnecessary administrative obligations .
</s>
<s id="1474:19">
We intend to monitor this aspect carefully and will add our conclusions to the report to the European Parliament and the Council , which is to be drawn up 5 years after the entry into force of this regulation .
</s>
<s id="1474:20">
I should also like to clarify that the Commission intends to work closely with the European Parliament and , naturally , with the Council , with regard to the implementation of this regulation .
</s>
<s id="1474:21">
To this end , I have asked my services - whom I thank for the contribution they always make to the legislative work of the Commission - to draw up a road map for implementation , which I intend to send to you as soon as possible .
</s>
<s id="1474:22">
This looks , in particular , at the so-called comitology aspects .
</s>
<s id="1474:23">
Parliament is a key partner of the Commission and I can assure you that I intend to continue to work closely with you , including with regard to the next phase in the adoption process .
</s>
<s id="1474:24">
Besides , 14 years in this Chamber were not spent in vain .
</s>
<s id="1474:25">
Finally , the Commission felt it necessary to present a statement regarding the departure from the common agreement between the institutions , relating to the deadline to submit an objection to delegated acts .
</s>
<s id="1474:26">
The Commission is keen to stress that the principle laid down in the draft common agreement provides for a 2-month period to submit objections , which may be extended by a further 2 months .
</s>
<s id="1474:27">
In this case , the Commission holds the view that there are no special circumstances that can justify the violation of this principle .
</s>
<s id="1474:28">
The Commission regrets the fact that the principle agreed in the draft common agreement has not been respected and emphasises in its statement that what has happened in the construction products case can not set a precedent .
</s>
<s id="1474:29">
I should like to thank Parliament - including through the President , whom I thank again for having participated in this debate - for the interest with which it examined this simplification proposal .
</s>
<s id="1474:30">
To conclude , I should like to highlight the advantages that we can expect from this new regulation , as well as those created for the producers and users of construction products , as well as national administrations .
</s>
<s id="1474:31">
We also confirm the Commission's willingness to adhere to the obligations contained in the text of the regulation , in particular , to draw up the reports that have been requested .
</s>
<s id="1474:32">
Thank you once again Mr President , and thank you honourable members for the commitment and cooperation you have shown .

Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I welcome the compromise reached in relation to some specific points that I feel are of vital importance to effectively achieve the objectives that we are proposing to reach under this legislative proposal .
</s>
<s id="1475:2">
I am referring to the retention of the rules on simplified procedures , which are surely designed to lighten the burdens and reduce the costs incurred by enterprises , and particularly small and medium-sized enterprises .
</s>
<s id="1475:3">
Indeed , I think that in the context of a negative economic situation like the present , it is absolutely essential to recognise the importance of the role played by small and medium-sized enterprises , which make up one of the fundamental foundation blocks on which our economy is based .
</s>
<s id="1475:4">
Furthermore , by introducing simplified procedural mechanisms and , in particular , by reducing the time it takes to place new products on the market , the new regulation definitely favours innovation .
</s>
<s id="1475:5">
At the same time , it also protects consumers , allowing them to gain faster access to innovative products without foregoing the guarantees of quality and safety that have to be ensured by CE marking .
</s>
<s id="1475:6">
Therefore , in my view , the agreement reached represents an excellent compromise that will strike the right balance between the needs of producers and those of consumers , thereby guaranteeing the proper functioning of the market in a sector that is truly the driving force of our European economy .

Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I support the words of Mr Harbour when he stresses the importance of the text that we are debating and that will be adopted thanks to this agreement from Parliament .
</s>
<s id="1476:2">
This is because it is a new piece of legislation that will give important guidance to the market but , at the same time , will establish good rules to allow small and medium-sized enterprises to expand , above all , in this final phase of the current crisis , during which we must do everything possible to ensure that small and medium-sized enterprises can create new jobs and grow .
</s>
<s id="1476:3">
This is the aim of the European Commission , which is backed up by the real commitment of the European Parliament , partly as a result of the implementation and development of the Small Business Act .
</s>
<s id="1476:4">
Small and medium-sized enterprises will benefit from simplification , including a reduction in red tape .
</s>
<s id="1476:5">
However , as Mrs Gebhardt said in her speech , these rules for the liberalisation and development of the market also provide real guidance on safety , which is of great importance for construction sector workers , but also consumers .
</s>
<s id="1476:6">
I believe that this report is heading in the right direction .
</s>
<s id="1476:7">
However , the Commission does not intend to stop with the adoption of the legislation that has resulted from the agreement and the compromise between the Council and Parliament .
</s>
<s id="1476:8">
We want to keep working on this over the coming years , and I should also like to assure Mr Harbour - who stressed the need to move forward - of our commitment to produce a road map for implementation , which I will forward to you as soon as possible .
</s>
<s id="1476:9">
During this debate , many of the honourable members have spoken about harmonisation in the construction sector , particularly with regard to safety .
</s>
<s id="1476:10">
I am fully mindful and aware of the problem and I am pleased to have drawn up the Eurocodes with the European Standards Organisation , since these are harmonised rules specifically relating to construction safety .
</s>
<s id="1476:11">
As you know , the Commission is currently preparing a communication on standardisation , which will be submitted for the attention of Parliament and the Council within a few weeks .
</s>
<s id="1476:12">
Therefore , madam President , honourable members , I believe that today and tomorrow , we are taking an important step forward .
</s>
<s id="1476:13">
To reiterate , it is not only a matter of technical rules , though I should like to thank the rapporteur for her patience in dealing with the technical rules , which , in any case , represent a snapshot of a major political commitment .
</s>
<s id="1476:14">
Behind the technical details there lurks an important economic choice favouring small and medium-sized enterprises , which can create new jobs over the coming years , as well as favouring half a billion European citizens .

Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I wanted to be one of the signatories of this oral question because I believe that it is essential , after the incident of recent weeks , to open a debate on food safety .
</s>
<s id="1478:2">
To what extent are the products that millions of Europeans consume every day healthy and nutritious ?
</s>
<s id="1478:3">
Are we really sure that the products on our kitchen tables are safe ?
</s>
<s id="1478:4">
Quality of raw materials is essential to guarantee the authenticity of the final product .
</s>
<s id="1478:5">
Constant monitoring , from the field to the table , is the only way to avoid the contamination of food products and immediately identify potential risks .
</s>
<s id="1478:6">
This latest incident in Germany confirms the need to make origin marking on labels obligatory for all products , including processed products , as Mr De Castro has already emphasised .
</s>
<s id="1478:7">
We must protect the consumer's right to know the provenance of every product bought , and the safety of our food can only be guaranteed by all operators sharing the responsibility .
</s>
<s id="1478:8">
It is true that current European legislation already provides for controls and procedures to guarantee that the food that ends up on our tables is fit for consumption and that the risks of contamination are reduced to a minimum , but we must now aim to make a daily contribution to improving the quality of these measures .
</s>
<s id="1478:9">
I am proud to point out that tomorrow , the Italian Parliament will approve a law that extends obligatory origin marking to all food products that do not already have it .
</s>
<s id="1478:10">
Finally , we will know the provenance of products such as pork , long-life milk , fruit , vegetables and some drinks , such as orangeade .

<s id="1478:11">
I hope that Europe can take inspiration from this law .
</s>
<s id="1478:12">
I will make an active commitment to ensure greater transparency , information and protection of consumer rights , which are instruments that I consider essential to promote healthy , wholesome food .

Amongst the associations that contacted me was the Amici dell ' adozione .
</s>
<s id="1479:3">
There are many abandoned children , not only in the developing world , but also in Europe .
</s>
<s id="1479:4">
These are children who become invisible and end up in the vicious circle of poverty and social exclusion or , worse still , are exploited by organised crime for begging , illegal work , prostitution , organ trafficking or illegal adoptions .
</s>
<s id="1479:5">
Often , these children spend their youth shuttling between social workers and orphanages .
</s>
<s id="1479:6">
We must guarantee these children the right to be adopted and the right to have a family .
</s>
<s id="1479:7">
A child should spend as little time as possible in an institution .
</s>
<s id="1479:8">
Obviously , the aim is the best interests of the child , so the ability to be adopted must certainly be granted warily , under the scrupulous supervision of the competent domestic authorities .
</s>
<s id="1479:9">
However , where suitable conditions exist , children have the right to be adopted , above all at national level , but also at international level , within the European Union .

I know that the Commission is aware of this , even if it is a matter of purely national competence .

However , some sort of cooperation between the Commission and Member States would be desirable to ensure good practices and strategies capable of guaranteeing the utmost transparency and to prevent possible illegal and casual adoptions , but also to ensure the maximum level of cooperation from Member States in guaranteeing the right of adoption and preventing children from being abandoned to themselves or , as I said before , abandoned to an institution .

<s id="1480:9">
What is more , if we want to restore the central role of the family - as we often say in this Chamber - we must make sure that the associations , which are very often the key vehicle of these adoptions , are characterised by particularly high standards of guarantee .
</s>
<s id="1480:10">
I would conclude , Commissioner Georgieva , by saying that if there is a suggestion to be made , then it is the following : why not provide a European system of accreditation for these associations , and ensure that they work transparently , clearly and practically , but with a high level of guarantees to truly protect the inalienable and inviolable rights of children ?

Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , for a number of years , many families in Italy and just as many Romanian children have been suffering the consequences of Romania's block on international adoptions .

The Hague Convention is the benchmark framework to be implemented uniformly in all countries of the European Union , and Romania needs to make an effort to adjust to it .

If Romania believes that the block on international adoptions works to protect children - for example , from the risk that a market for the illegal trafficking of children would be created - it must also deal with this problem with the help of the European Union , by toughening up controls and introducing strict regulations .

However , we need to make an effort to ensure that many respectable families can adopt children , who deserve a second chance for a happy childhood .

Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this evening , we are tackling a debate that is partly the fruit of the work of many associations across the continent and the European Union that turned to us precisely in order to deal with this delicate topic , which was initiated by Mrs Angelilli , and which we have turned into this oral question .
</s>
<s id="1483:2">
From a dialectical point of view , they have presented us with a very simple problem , or so it would seem .
</s>
<s id="1483:3">
There are many children in institutions across Europe and there are many families that want to adopt children .
</s>
<s id="1483:4">
However , these 2 paths do not often seem to cross and the children remain in care and the families remain childless .
</s>
<s id="1483:5">
Clearly , these children are our priority .
</s>
<s id="1483:6">
They have our attention and they need us to take all the precautions that the situation requires .
</s>
<s id="1483:7">
However , when these children remain in care for too long , they are often targeted by traders in prostitution and organ trafficking for these new slave traders .
</s>
<s id="1483:8">
All this is happening whilst , meanwhile , many families would like to open their homes to these children .
</s>
<s id="1483:9">
I am therefore very happy to have heard the Commissioner outline the measures that she intends to adopt .
</s>
<s id="1483:10">
However , we must also add the possibility for greater cooperation between the Member States for collaboration in international adoptions , as well as supervision in relation to the protection of adopted children , obviously .
</s>
<s id="1483:11">
We therefore ask for more streamlined procedures for the families and the children , because in a few years' time , these former children and young people will have become men and women and will ask themselves why a Europe full of potential host families left them in their condition .

Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I signed the oral question tabled by Mrs Angelilli because I think that the European Union can not but make the protection of children one of its priorities , particularly in the light of the Treaty of Lisbon .
</s>
<s id="1484:2">
In my opinion , adoption procedures are only the litmus test of a social issue that we are duty bound to tackle and impose some boundaries upon .
</s>
<s id="1484:3">
In the best cases , the children become objects of commercial exchanges that certainly offend our dignity , but unfortunately , they are often also victims of exploitation and violence .
</s>
<s id="1484:4">
Beyond the phenomenon of so-called ghost children - meaning those born illegally or abandoned and never picked up by the system - there is an undetermined number of children who can be adopted and who are matched by an equal number of couples hoping to adopt , who never cross paths due to legislative interpretation and cumbersome bureaucracy .
</s>
<s id="1484:5">
The United Nations Children's Fund recently published a study containing some alarming figures , including with regard to many European countries .
</s>
<s id="1484:6">
As Chair of the committee on petitions , I have often run up against legal conflicts between Member States which result in negative or even tragic consequences for the children alone .
</s>
<s id="1484:7">
The complex procedures involved in many national systems do not always turn out to be beneficial for the child .
</s>
<s id="1484:8">
The long time frames involved are at odds with the need to have the child placed within the first year of his or her life to reduce the trauma of the upheaval and to avoid long stays in orphanages , and also because we should consider that above a certain age , there is lower market demand , unfortunately .
</s>
<s id="1484:9">
In the light of these figures , I believe that the green light should be given to the long-heralded need for Europe-wide coordination of national laws which , firstly , will help simplify inter-European adoption procedures and , secondly , will guarantee that the fundamental principles of adoption are observed when children are adopted from third countries .

Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , having voted firmly in favour of this important report , I would like to emphasise , in particular , paragraph 35 of the well-structured opinion of the committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety which , in considering that the European Food Safety Authority ( EFSA ) has a major role to play in the assessment of all risks associated with the food chain as part of a set of measures designed to protect the health and well-being of the public , hopes that all Member States will set up corresponding national bodies to collaborate with the EFSA .

Since 1992 , Italy has provided incentives by increasing its citizens' energy bills and building incinerators , which are scientifically proven to be bad for people's health and the environment and which the European Union has thus classified as a residual integrated waste management option . 2 infringement procedures have been launched with regard to these incentives and , despite formal legislative intervention , in Italy , waste incineration is still being encouraged as a source of renewable energy , with the Acerra case being just one example of this .

<s id="1502:1">
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I have to say that I , too , am puzzled about why this question has been combined with the previous report , but the important thing , to my mind , is that this House is today focusing on the issue contained in the question I tabled on behalf of the committee on Petitions .
</s>
<s id="1502:2">
This question refers to a case in which a small European business has been denied justice because of the inertia that the Commission has unfortunately demonstrated from 1997 until now .
</s>
<s id="1502:3">
This finding is supported by the committee on Legal Affairs , which has been asked to issue an opinion by the committee which I chair .
</s>
<s id="1502:4">
The issue concerns a medical device - specifically an asthma inhaler - which was patented in 1990 and lawfully placed on the market .
</s>
<s id="1502:5">
This product is regulated by Directive 93EEC , which stipulates that manufacturers must certify that they have complied with requirements and which empowers the national authorities to verify that this self-certification is valid , through monitoring and sample checks .
</s>
<s id="1502:6">
The product , which was successfully distributed on the market for 6 years - thus , until 1996 - and for which not a single specific complaint or comment was recorded in over 15 years , was submitted for an inspection by the government of Upper Bavaria , which asked the commission of Magdeburg to review the authorisation granted to the company .
</s>
<s id="1502:7">
In December of that year , the commission and the Minister for Health in Saxony-Anhalt carried out this inspection and concluded the procedure by stating that the product fully complied with the legislative requirements in force .
</s>
<s id="1502:8">
At the end of the procedure , they also questioned the legitimacy of the request made by the government of Upper Bavaria and invited it to initiate the safeguard clause procedure pursuant to the aforesaid Directive if it continued to have doubts .
</s>
<s id="1502:9">
The following year , there was a series of undocumented activities about which we were only indirectly informed , and then , suddenly , in 1997 , without any communication with the manufacturer , the Federal Minister for Health ordered the product to be withdrawn from the market .
</s>
<s id="1502:10">
The Ministry initiated the procedure - the procedure pursuant to Article 8 of the aforesaid Directive - at the end of 1997 , but it drew a blank , because no information was provided and the process of consulting the manufacturer was not initiated .
</s>
<s id="1502:11">
Amid the general silence , in mid-2003 , the manufacturer , thinking that this silence meant that the German authorities' unexplained comments had clearly been refuted , placed the product back on the market .
</s>
<s id="1502:12">
Unfortunately , in 2005 - and again without any communication - the German authorities ordered the product to be withdrawn from the market once more .
</s>
<s id="1502:13">
To be clear , despite repeated requests , there has been no explanation to this day for why the product was withdrawn .
</s>
<s id="1502:14">
Hence , there has been no communication , no investigation and no opportunity for the manufacturer to legitimately challenge the other party's findings .
</s>
<s id="1502:15">
This has had a serious economic impact on the manufacturer , because he has been waiting for a response for more than 15 years and can not place his product on the market .
</s>
<s id="1502:16">
I would also add that , during the 6 years in which the product was distributed - and there are documents on this , including ones provided by the Commission - it was found that significant savings were made in public health expenditure due to the low cost of the product , and that the product had a positive impact on asthma sufferers .
</s>
<s id="1502:17">
In 2008 , having seen all his attempts to get somewhere with the other authorities fail , Mr Klein , the manufacturer , turned to the committee on Petitions .
</s>
<s id="1502:18">
The committee is initiating the procedure during this legislative term .
</s>
<s id="1502:19">
Moreover , in view of the length of time the matter referred to in the petition has been going on , it is also launching an informal consultation process with the Commissioner to request that a response be provided within a shorter time frame , because the petitioner is requesting confirmation that his product complies with European legislation or , failing that , at least to have a ruling that he can challenge before the Court and which will therefore allow him to have justice .
</s>
<s id="1502:20">
None of this has happened , and during the debate within the committee on Petitions , the European Commission unfortunately avoided answering our questions once again .
</s>
<s id="1502:21">
Hence , the committee has taken the unanimous decision to come to Parliament and ask the Commission to provide clear answers in this House , because this affair undeniably raises serious doubts with regard to a violation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
</s>
<s id="1502:22">
This is not only because of the Commission's inertia ;
</s>
<s id="1502:23">
it is also and , above all , because of the petitioner Mr Klein's inability to take legal action .
</s>
<s id="1502:24">
The affair raises obvious doubts with regard to the violation of market rules and the protection afforded to small businesses , which is why we are insisting that answers be provided , here , to the points raised in our question .

Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the European tourism industry , like many other economic sectors , has to face the ever greater challenge of globalisation .
</s>
<s id="1504:2">
This is a challenge that the Commission has already emphasised and addressed on many occasions , in particular , with the communication ' An industrial policy for the globalisation era ' .
</s>
<s id="1504:3">
Furthermore , on 30 June last year , the Commission adopted a specific communication on tourism , which proposes - in line with the Treaty of Lisbon and the new Europe 2020 strategy - a consolidated political framework to strengthen competitiveness in the sector , with the aim of making European tourism a truly competitive , modern , sustainable and responsible industry .
</s>
<s id="1504:4">
The creation of an environment that is conducive to the development of micro , small and medium-sized enterprises in the tourism sector is the principle on which this consolidated framework is based .
</s>
<s id="1504:5">
To achieve this objective , we proposed 3 specific measures aimed , firstly , at stimulating competitiveness in the European tourism sector ;
</s>
<s id="1504:6">
secondly , at promoting the development of sustainable , responsible and high quality tourism ;
</s>
<s id="1504:7">
and thirdly , at consolidating the image and profile of Europe as a collection of sustainable and high quality tourist destinations and , of course , maximising the potential of EU financial policies and instruments for developing tourism .
</s>
<s id="1504:8">
The initiatives promoted should provide the sector with the instruments necessary to adapt to the challenges faced by its operators , and to work towards its sustainable development in terms of competitiveness .
</s>
<s id="1504:9">
Of course , specific measures will be taken to promote innovation in the tourism sector , reinforce the quality of tourism services and improve the professional skills of tourism workers , because we must no longer regard tourism as a sector consisting exclusively of family businesses ;
</s>
<s id="1504:10">
we must also consider how we can make it more modern and more competitive .
</s>
<s id="1504:11">
I will give a few examples regarding training and professional skills : an ' ICT and tourism ' platform will be launched to facilitate the adaptation of the tourism sector and its businesses to developments in the new information technologies market and improve their competitiveness .
</s>
<s id="1504:12">
All of these proposals and ideas are contained in the Commission communication , which has been approved by the Council and which we are debating in Parliament - the rapporteur is present in the Chamber .
</s>
<s id="1504:13">
The industry's operators will be encouraged to make better use of the Union's various programmes , such as Leonardo , the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme , Erasmus for young entrepreneurs , the European Social Fund and other programmes .
</s>
<s id="1504:14">
Furthermore , a strategy to promote the diversification of tourist services and the creation of a virtual electronic observatory for European tourism will likewise help to create a favourable environment for the sector's operators .
</s>
<s id="1504:15">
In addition , I must point out that small and medium-sized enterprises can benefit from other cross-cutting initiatives to access funding .
</s>
<s id="1504:16">
I would mention JEREMIE , the joint initiative of the Commission , the European Investment Fund and the European Investment Bank , which is aimed at improving access to funding for micro , small and medium-sized enterprises , in particular , through the channels of risk capital , loans , securities , micro-credit and other forms of repayable aid .
</s>
<s id="1504:17">
Lastly , I would point out that small and medium-sized enterprises in the tourism sector are fully covered by the measures proposed in the framework of the Small Business Act , which is intended to promote the business environment of those very same enterprises .
</s>
<s id="1504:18">
Parliament will receive the updated text in a few weeks' time .
</s>
<s id="1504:19">
Hence , the Small Business Act will also become an instrument for safeguarding small and medium-sized enterprises , which offer huge potential in terms of the development of a sector that I hope to be able to strengthen over the next year , because I am absolutely convinced that a European policy , as laid down in the Treaty , can bring added value to the excellent work that is already being done by Europe's regions and the Member States .
</s>
<s id="1504:20">
I therefore feel able to reassure the honourable member who tabled the question that the Commission and I are committed to ensuring that all small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector are supported and assisted in their efforts to access EU economic instruments , as part of a political strategy aimed at making tourism one of our key economic and industrial policy sectors .

Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I wish to thank Mr Balcytis since he has given me an opportunity to speak on an issue that , of all the issues for which I am responsible as European Commissioner , is particularly close to my heart , and as the first European Commissioner for Tourism , I believe that tourism policy , together with industrial policy and space policy , is a priority .
</s>
<s id="1506:2">
To give a concrete answer , however , the central issue , aside from the policy initiatives that I have tried to implement since becoming Commissioner , is the one that Mr Fidanza raised in his speech : since the EU was not responsible for tourism policy prior to the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , the current financial perspective does not include the funds necessary for the EU to contribute to a strong tourism effort .
</s>
<s id="1506:3">
We have interesting programmes such as Calypso , which , in Spain , have been enhanced by what are , in my view , some very positive regional initiatives .
</s>
<s id="1506:4">
However , while I clearly understood the point made by Mr Fidanza in the report that Parliament is due to submit , there will be support , because the funds earmarked for tourism policy will be increased in the next financial perspective .
</s>
<s id="1506:5">
They may be increased in the 8th framework programme , or through the introduction of ad hoc budget lines .

The important thing , however , is that Parliament brings the problem to light , because it is difficult to give concrete answers if the economic instruments are not in place .

As you know , countless initiatives have been taken , the Belgian Presidency organised a major event in Malta , and the Hungarian Presidency has already announced that it will organise a major event specifically devoted to tourism - this was the topic of our first meeting , which was held in Budapest a few days ago .

I am glad that Mr Balcytis raised the issue of tourism in the Baltic region : tourism is not an issue that exclusively concerns the economies of Mediterranean countries - Spain , France , Italy , Greece and Malta .

It is an extremely important resource for the whole of the European Union , including the countries of Central and Eastern Europe , which have their own sights and their own potential to be developed .

On the subject of the Baltic States , I believe that one of the issues - which , incidentally , is addressed in the text that was approved on 30 June last year - is the relationship with the new emerging classes , with the new middle class in Russia .

The European Commission and the tourism ministers are determined to try to resolve this problem regarding potential visitors from both Russia and China .

We want to speed matters up and make it easier for them to be admitted into our countries .

This is at the very heart of our work to promote tourism policies , and I am also encouraged by the fact that many ministers from the various Member States , including the United Kingdom - I met the UK's new tourism minister a few weeks ago in London - and France , are firmly committed to supporting EU tourism policy .

It is important to identify a number of gateways , because Europe must represent added value .

In short , we must ensure that every country in the EU can act as a gateway for tourists to enter and visit that country , but then to go and visit other European countries once they have finished .

This is the additional action the European Commission can take , and Parliament's support is crucial as far as I am concerned .

Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , unfortunately , everyone is now well aware of the situation that Campania and particularly the city of Naples have been living through for years , and the European Union has had to deal with this issue many times .
</s>
<s id="1508:2">
In the face of this now paradoxical third-world situation , I would like to know from the Commission what consequences Italy will face from the point of view of European law and what financial penalties may be imposed on it if the waste crisis in Campania is not definitively resolved soon .
</s>
<s id="1508:3">
I would also like to know whether the Commission can provide detailed information about the European funding that the Campania region has received up to now for the creation of the integrated waste collection and disposal system .

<s id="1508:4">
You see , Commissioner , usually , when we talk about crises , we talk about tragic , extreme situations , but they are still resolved within a reasonable time frame .
</s>
<s id="1508:5">
When a so-called ' crisis ' lasts more than 15 years , something is clearly going wrong .
</s>
<s id="1508:6">
In recent years , the Italian government has tried everything possible to resolve the long-standing issue of the waste collection and disposal system .
</s>
<s id="1508:7">
However , the fact that the streets of Naples are today swamped by tonnes and tonnes of rubbish is clearly the fault , first and foremost , of the local authorities in Campania and of their total incompetence or reluctance to work to find a solution .
</s>
<s id="1508:8">
It is clear - crystal clear in fact - that the conditions affecting Naples and Campania are due to the evasion of responsibility that has characterised the municipality , the province and the region for many years where waste management is concerned .
</s>
<s id="1508:9">
Central government can not be blamed for the fact that separate collection , the first crucial element of an effective waste management plan , has not been imposed .
</s>
<s id="1508:10">
Central government clearly can not be blamed for the fact that it had to send the army a few weeks ago - but also on other previous occasions - to replace hundreds of refuse collectors who suddenly fell ill at the same time .
</s>
<s id="1508:11">
The fact that the crisis has hit Naples while the situation is very different in the rest of Italy , for example , in my region , Veneto , where separate collection has been taking place for years without any problems and with a very high recycling rate , means that the responsibility for the crisis lies with Campanian policy making , with local government officials and , above all , with the serious collusion with the underworld , which has always sought and made huge profits from the waste business thanks to the Camorra's infiltrating local policy making and local government .

Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I am grateful to the Commissioner for having sought to point out that the committee on Petitions has given an active role to this Parliament , so as to demonstrate that those who speak here , and the political groups that they represent , have every interest in dealing with this situation responsibly , in making all the procedures transparent and in involving the public in a dialogue that gives everyone a sense of responsibility .

<s id="1509:2">
As has already been said , the regional executive which , I would remind you , was formed only in May 2010 , has developed a close dialogue with the European Commission in recent months , beginning a process that we can certainly regard as a departure from that of previous years .

The Commission is rightly being vigilant , and I hope that this debate will not be used to further work against the institutions and the political parties .

Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , despite the Italian government's propaganda , which was soon disproved by the Commission , the waste crisis in Campania is a structural problem that is anything but resolved .
</s>
<s id="1511:2">
Questionable lists aside , we need to realise one thing : the people of Campania continue to live - and die - surrounded by waste .

<s id="1511:3">
The local , regional and national politicians , on the right and on the left , have an enormous responsibility .

<s id="1511:4">
The task of solving the problem can not be offloaded on to the citizens , who are already suffering from completely unhealthy living conditions .

<s id="1511:5">
The European Union must insist that a worthy solution is found , or else its intervention will have been in vain .
</s>
<s id="1511:6">
The construction of incinerators , which , by the way , are financed as renewable energy sources and thereby infringe current European legislation , will not solve the issue .
</s>
<s id="1511:7">
The waste would be turned into ash , causing harmful and deadly emissions .
</s>
<s id="1511:8">
Pursuant to the waste Directive , incinerators shall be the last option in a hierarchy of integrated waste systems that presents virtuous alternatives that have no public health or environmental impact but instead create employment .

As far as Mafia infiltration is concerned , I feel it should be acknowledged that , while Mafia infiltration , particularly in the field of waste , does happen in the South , it happens primarily in the North .

This has been especially true over the last few years .
</s>
<s id="1511:11">
I therefore have 3 questions for the Commission : what action does it intend to take to ensure that the solution to the problem does not affect people's health , and how does it intend to prevent decisions from being imposed on the public and areas from actually becoming militarised ?

<s id="1511:12">
Does it think that the immediate launch of a cancer registry for the entire region should be one of the conditions for closing the infringement procedure ?

It would therefore be extremely unfair , counterproductive and exploitative to do as Mr De Magistris is requesting : imposing inhibitory penalties and measures today would harm institutions that are cooperating fully with the European Union as they attempt to close this terrible chapter in the age-old history of Naples and Campania through the efficient use of European and national resources .

Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , in taking the floor , I wish to clearly state that the waste situation in Campania is better than it was before and is in the process of being resolved .

The issue is a very complex one ;

it presents various types of problem , and finding an appropriate , definitive solution to it will take time .

The oral questions we are discussing call for the application of the procedure laid down in Article 260 of the Treaty , but applying a financial penalty will not resolve the situation in Campania .

The subjective behaviour of the State must be taken into account , too .

<s id="1517:7">
It certainly can not be said that Italy has failed to meet the obligation of sincere cooperation , but as the Commissioner has confirmed , the Commission staff are in constant contact with the Italian national and regional authorities and are closely monitoring the development of the situation .

Europe must show solidarity with Italy , with both parties cooperating in perfect synergy .

<s id="1518:3">
The Campania region and , in general , the Italian State are working on the creation of a network of waste disposal installations , in accordance with European law .

<s id="1518:4">
I wish to point out that the European funds earmarked for waste disposal in Campania have been used for measure 1.7 of Regional Operational Programme ( ROP ) 2000 - 2006 and for operating target 1.1 of ROP 2007 - 2013 .

With regard to ROP 2000 - 2006 , the Campania region has accounted for the EUR 140 million funding package made available ;

the money has been used to construct storage , treatment and recovery facilities , waste to energy facilities , and wet and dry separation facilities , to secure landfills , to construct , or extend , waste materials recovery facilities , and to implement separate-collection measures .

<s id="1518:7">
As for ROP 2007 - 2013 , EUR 110 million has been earmarked for the construction of waste treatment facilities , and EUR 50 million for the financing of municipal separate-collection facilities .

<s id="1518:8">
The activities carried out under target 1.1 of ROP ERDF 2007 - 2013 and measure 1.7 of ROP 2000 - 2006 have been greatly restricted by the spending conditions imposed as a result of the infringement procedure launched in relation to the waste management situation in Campania .
</s>
<s id="1518:9">
Consequently , a sum from the Fund for Underused Areas ( FAS ) has been set aside thus far to ensure the continuation of the activities subject to the European veto on the granting of ROP funds .

To conclude , we feel it is important to be able to present to the Commission and Parliament the real difficulties that exist in complying quickly with the Court of Justice ruling .

We are talking about one of the poorest regions in the world , bordering on some of the countries that have been shaken over the last week by more dangerous instability than ever .

<s id="1536:2">
As we know , given the lack of borders and the huge size of the region , the Sahel is an ideal area of transit for drug traffickers and terrorist groups , specifically al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb .

The weakness and instability of the states in this region are the main problem and , as has been pointed out , the threats directly affect the peoples and countries in the region , particularly Mauritania , Mali and Niger .

The main task the European Union has to address is to draw up a credible security strategy based on the various facets of possible European action : cooperation and development policy , regional programmes , coordination strategies for highway security , and security training policies .

<s id="1537:1">
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the work done by Mrs Gomes in my view makes a serious contribution to what the Commission should do in defining the framework agreement .
</s>
<s id="1537:2">
Libya undoubtedly plays a decisive role in the fight against terrorism , in peace and security in Africa , in the fight against illegal immigration in the Mediterranean , and in the energy sector .
</s>
<s id="1537:3">
Our aim in the context of the European Union's strategy must therefore be to consolidate Libya's integration into an international political and economic system based on shared rules .
</s>
<s id="1537:4">
To achieve that , a number of conditions need to be imposed on Libya , and that is what the recommendation is calling for .
</s>
<s id="1537:5">
First of all , in the matter of immigration , Libya is clearly a transit country .
</s>
<s id="1537:6">
This is an extremely important subject , but it can not be seen simply in terms of security , stopping immigration and refoulement .
</s>
<s id="1537:7">
The subject involves the need for a government ruled by the streams of economic and social policies equal to the challenge of migration , the issues of the recognition of political refugees and the ratification by Libya of the Geneva Convention and , lastly , the problem of the readmission of immigrants based on concrete guarantees to safeguard the immigrants' living conditions .
</s>
<s id="1537:8">
Then there is the question of launching economic and democratic reforms to make decidedly more room for democracy in this important country .
</s>
<s id="1537:9">
We shall have to take this issue into ever greater account , as the events in neighbouring Tunisia are showing .
</s>
<s id="1537:10">
Lastly , this recommendation calls for reflection on the issue of bilateral agreements .
</s>
<s id="1537:11">
Such agreements can certainly make a valid contribution to defining and solving problems , but they are not the final answer .
</s>
<s id="1537:12">
For example , the problem we have with Italian fishing boats shows that the bilateral agreement option does not address these problems .
</s>
<s id="1537:13">
Now , however , the review of the partnership and neighbourhood policies also involves the call to rethink the Libya question in a new framework , which means including Parliament .
</s>
<s id="1537:14">
Many of us have called for the Council's mandate for the framework agreement to be made known .
</s>
<s id="1537:15">
In this respect , Commissioner , there is a real need to break step and involve the European Parliament more and more in defining new policies for the countries to the south of Europe .

Another important subject is Libya's control over terrorist activities , not only on its own territory , but also on the country's southern borders .

Progress has been made with an agreement between the Council and the Libyan government , including on general principles such as the Statute of Rome and the United Nations Convention on Refugees .

Much remains to be done - that is obvious - but it is important for Parliament to support the agreement already negotiated without bringing it back into discussion and risk losing the results that have already been achieved .

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the outcome we have arrived at is extremely ambitious.

I should like to note that CO2 emissions from these vehicles are currently around 200 g per square kilometre.

<s id="2357:3">
Reducing this to 147 g therefore cuts this threshold by more than 25%.

<s id="2357:4">
Furthermore, I would emphasise that marginal reductions are the most costly, so we should be careful.

I also think that this particular category of vehicles cannot be compared to passenger cars, as has often been the case in this House.

<s id="2357:6">
The cycles of production are much longer and it would have a mere 1.5% effect on CO2 emissions across the whole transport sector.

<s id="2357:7">
If we do not establish our central aim, we will end up penalising a sector that has already suffered an abrupt contraction of more than 30%, above all, hurting small and medium-sized enterprises, which, just 12 hours ago, all of us in this House confirmed we wanted to support due to the huge economic and social role they play as the only true engine of employment in Europe.

Some steps forward have been made in the last few years at European level, especially through a 2009 directive, but there is still much to do, especially to guarantee full civil rights to sufferers from this condition in the world of work and of mobility, and in guaranteeing the availability of medication during school hours.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not want to break up this joyful atmosphere.

<s id="2373:2">
It is true that we have come to the end of the phase begun in 2005, during which diplomacy helped to ensure that events unfolded in the best possible way.
</s>
<s id="2373:3">
However, there are still many unresolved problems.

<s id="2373:4">
This is a young country and will be a young country once secession has taken place.

<s id="2373:5">
It is a country that still needs to establish its borders, address the issue we have heard mentioned several times of the conflicts in the Abyei region, the issue of the oil pipeline, which is the most important thing in that country, and also the international aid system.
</s>
<s id="2373:6">
I would therefore like to make a very simple point to the Commissioner.
</s>
<s id="2373:7">
There are two or three things that we need to do.
</s>
<s id="2373:8">
We need to establish a strategy for Southern Sudan, and recognise this new State on 7 February, without waiting until 9 July when the results of the election are made official.
</s>
<s id="2373:9">
We also need to put our international service into action immediately, and establish a delegation in Southern Sudan.
</s>
<s id="2373:10">
This is the only way to support a process; this is the only way for smart, strategic diplomacy to support this country on the path to democracy.
</s>
<s id="2373:11">
I would note that the first thing that the country needs to do is to draw up its constitution, and Europe can be of great help in this.

<s id="2377:1">
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think this debate has been very interesting and has partly restated some of the anxieties and issues which we have already looked at in the Committee on International Trade.
</s>
<s id="2377:2">
I should like to re-emphasise an important fact that I think we lose sight of every now and then.
</s>
<s id="2377:3">
These agreements represent the implementation of a specific commitment made by the European Union, in its role as a member of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
</s>
<s id="2377:4">
We must not forget this.
</s>
<s id="2377:5">
Through these agreements, the EU is undertaking to resolve a serious problem with important countries, which it is having to sort out because it has breached the principle of non-discrimination.
</s>
<s id="2377:6">
These are therefore agreements that restore our credibility and proper position as members of the WTO.
</s>
<s id="2377:7">
This agreement follows on therefore from disputes and tensions, amid a climate that will certainly have been damaging for other areas of our relationships.
</s>
<s id="2377:8">
As a definitive settlement agreement it is trying and succeeding to create a new balance, with particular attention, as we have said and have also stated in the resolution, to countries in fragile states of development.
</s>
<s id="2377:9">
The accompanying measures will now certainly be monitored, and to my mind this is the most important point.
</s>
<s id="2377:10">
It is important to have established the accompanying measures, but it will be even more important to have the evaluations of their impact and to have the commitment, which I am delighted to have heard today from the Council and the Commission, to keep constant track of the situation as it develops and above all the willingness to assist with further measures if they should prove to be necessary.
</s>
<s id="2377:11">
POSEI (Programme of Options Specifically Relating to Remoteness and Insularity) itself has been incorporated into the resolution as a sensitive point that must be monitored due to the delicate balance between the financial contributions made under POSEI and the new situation regarding the outermost regions.
</s>
<s id="2377:12">
Therefore the impact of the agreements on the outermost EU regions where bananas are produced will also be monitored and watched carefully.
</s>
<s id="2377:13">
The Council also mentioned the need to work on transparency in the agri-food chain, which I am happy about, as it is an important point.
</s>
<s id="2377:14">
We have been talking about producers the whole time, but there is also the major issue of banana distribution within the EU.
</s>
<s id="2377:15">
There are many things that must be done going forward, therefore.
</s>
<s id="2377:16">
We need to monitor the effects of the agreements, the implementation of the accompanying measures and the suitability of POSEI to protect Europe’s producers.
</s>
<s id="2377:17">
We also need to use other instruments such as transparency in the agri-food chain and hence widen the scope of examination to take in the distribution chain as well, which has a major impact on the final cost of the fruit.
</s>
<s id="2377:18">
We need to look at consumer protection, which is something that deserves our attention as much as all the other interests involved in this business.
</s>
<s id="2377:19">
However, all these things, not least consumer protection, must start with the current situation and establishing the outcome of these disputes in which the EU has had to make concessions to the United States and the Latin American countries.
</s>
<s id="2377:20">
I hope therefore that these agreements will be adopted, because I believe they form an essential basis for making the instruments linked to the delicate balance of the banana market work and can guarantee clear practices that will benefit other interests also, such as consumer protection, which is linked to transparency in the agri-food chain.
</s>
<s id="2377:21">
These will in turn bring improvements to the banana market and to our European producers, which are impossible without a sound basis such as that provided by finalising these disputes within the WTO, to which the European Union belongs.

We did not vote against the report because some rights are protected, such as those of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility.

That is why we abstained.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to thank the Commissioner for her efforts and for the efforts she will continue to make in dealing with this humanitarian emergency.

<s id="2389:2">
However, Commissioner, you know as well as I do that the real emergency is not the humanitarian one – which is only an after-effect – but the fact that, during this historic uprising across the whole of the Maghreb, Europe has appeared inadequate, which is to say, it has been unable to redevelop a strategy for the Mediterranean, as it has tried to several times and always failed.

We need to confront them together, but today the Council is not here.

<s id="2389:6">
We asked the Council to look at the issue of having a European strategy to deal not so much with the problem of immigration and illegal immigration, but rather the question of democracy and freedom across the whole Mediterranean area.
</s>
<s id="2389:7">
When the Soviet Bloc collapsed, presenting a united front, we all gave practical answers and easily dealt with the problem of the thousands of Poles who arrived on our streets, because we looked at the problem of integrating the whole of the East into Europe.

Regarding the Mediterranean, today we have nothing to say.

In fact, the situation was not even foreseen by the representatives of the Socialist International, one of whose members was the nice Tunisian dictator, whose brilliant social and political management of that country led to all this.

We would not be in this situation if my fellow Members had listened to us when, on previous occasions – in committee meetings and discussions in this Chamber – we asked if it was possible to wait for a while, because the Hungarian Government had, after all, always proved willing to accommodate the European Commission’s views – and it would have been strange if it had been any other way, given that Hungary currently holds the Presidency of the European Union.

Yet they resolved to go ahead anyway, perhaps – no, definitely – because of political and ideological elements, deciding that this debate should take place.

Resolutions have been submitted that are due to be put to the vote tomorrow.
</s>
<s id="2405:5">
More caution probably should have been exercised and more confidence shown in those governments elected democratically by their peoples, starting with the Hungarian Government, which was elected by such a large majority of its people that it certainly did not need to manipulate the media in order to achieve an internal consensus.
</s>
<s id="2405:6">
Personally I think the most useful thing to do is to ask our fellow socialist and liberal MEPs, who submitted resolutions of a certain type, to withdraw them, thus stopping us from making fools of ourselves and letting Parliament get back to dealing with the real problems of European citizens.

In other words, I believe that, in order to avoid an unpleasant chapter in our Parliament’s history, we must take responsibility for not voting tomorrow and simply scrap a resolution of which the contents have no foundation in reality, as the Commissioner’s speech showed.

I therefore call on both the Council and the Commission to make informal contact with the Conference of Presidents, so as to allow for the necessary and essential exchange of information that will enable Parliament to vote tomorrow, even before the resolutions, on a decision not to proceed with a vote, thus putting an end to ideological debates.
